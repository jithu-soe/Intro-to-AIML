## 1. Introduction to Storage and Variables

### 1.1 What is Computer Storage?

Computer storage is where all data is saved. The fundamental unit of storage is a **bit**, which can be either a **0** or a **1**. Larger units like bytes, kilobytes, and megabytes are built from these bits.

### 1.2 How Data is Stored

Different types of data are converted into binary sequences to be stored.

* **Numericals (int, float):** Integers use encoding like **two's complement**, while floating-point numbers use the **IEEE 754** standard.
* **Characters (char, string):** Text is encoded using schemes like **ASCII** or **Unicode**. For example, the character 'A' is stored as the binary sequence for 65.

### 1.3 Variables and Memory

Every value is stored at a specific **memory address**, represented in hexadecimal. A **variable** is a friendly name we give to one of these addresses, making it easy to access and manipulate the data without remembering complex codes.

### 1.4 Variable Naming Conventions

For code to be readable, variable names must follow specific rules:
* They must be a single, continuous word.
* They cannot be reserved keywords (e.g., `if`, `while`).
* They must not start with a number.
* They should be descriptive.

Common conventions include:
* **camelCase:** `myVariableName`
* **snake_case:** `my_variable_name`

### 1.5 Input and Output

We use functions to interact with our programs:
* `print()`: Displays output to the console.
* `input()`: Prompts the user for input and returns it as a string.
